# GameMlemDiscordBot
A bot for my Game Mlem discord room

**You can run this bot your own by just clone this repository and provide the DISCORD_TOKEN and maybe some other games stuff if it's required in .env file of the Auth folder, then just run the Main.java. In case you don't know what's .env file, so basiclly that's an enviroment file, you need to google how to create enviroment variable, and i'll read enviroment variable that corresponding to the variable in the .env file to get the data**
